The hardest part of editing your site's design using CSS is usually finding the correct selector to use. The powerful inspector that comes with SiteOrigin CSS makes this easy. While viewing a full preview of your site, just click on an element, and it'll help you identify the best selector to use to target that element.

The inspector will help you even if you have no idea what a CSS selector is.
